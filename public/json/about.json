      "This website is built as a prototype portfolio of projects made during and after my bachelor study at Gerrit Rietveld Academy. In the end of October 2017 I have started attending an intensive FullStack Javascript Development course and the <i>Code</i> tab has visual references to some of the projects that Iâ€™ve done during and after completing the course on January 19th this year. The website will be regularly updated with more visual materials, descriptions of the projects and extra functionality.",
      "Currently I am looking for a Junior Web Developer position in Amsterdam, if anything presented on this websites strikes an interest, feel free to lookup my GitHub account or contact me."
